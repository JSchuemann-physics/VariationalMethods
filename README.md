# Variational Quantum Ground State Estimation

Implementation of the variational method to find an upper bound for the ground state energy of one-dimensional quantum systems.

## Overview
This project utilizes **importance sampling** and the **Metropolis algorithm** to perform numerical optimizations. Three quantum systems, the harmonic oszillator (HO), the hydrogen atom, and the poeschl-teller potential are implemented. The exact solutions are given as comments in the respected files. This project was originally developed for a seminar talk in December 2024.

## Methodology
The implementation follows the approach described in:
* *Pottorf et al.; Eur. J. Phys. 20 (1999) 205*

## Technical Details
* **Language:** Python 
* **Algorithms:** Metropolis-Hastings, Variational Monte Carlo
* **Scope:** 1D Quantum Systems
